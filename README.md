# *Key findings*
* ### *Total number of rides recorded over the period of January 2020 to December 2020 by collating the total monthly rides of each type of bike user i.e Annual member riders and Casual riders. Total rides recorded for the period total 3,541,683 where casual riders record 1,366,575 number of rides and annual members record 2,175,108.*
* ![Station 676 ](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Belladata/assets/134503256/3741ef23-c59b-47ce-aeb3-ba21e369f218)

# *Recommendation*
* ### *Station 676 - Watson Testing Divvy which is highly accessed by casual riders should increase their functionality on weekends. If the station opens more on weekends, the casual riders would not be limited to how they can access the station to have their rides. This will encourage them to become full members as they know they will be enjoying maximum benefits and they will not be experiencing any limitations.*
